# 🎟️ Ticket Generator

## Description
This project was a challenge from Frontend Mentor, created to practice JavaScript.
In this project, I built an interactive form where the user can enter their information and, by clicking on “Generate Ticket”, a personalized ticket is instantly generated with their details.

## Difficulty and Learning
I faced some difficulties with JavaScript logic, since this was my first project with several integrated features.
Even with the challenges, I managed to complete it successfully — I developed many parts on my own, and whenever I got stuck, I researched and learned more to improve my skills.
This project helped me strengthen my knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Features
- Responsive, adaptable to different screen sizes

- Built with HTML, CSS, and pure JavaScript

- Form validation (shows messages when the email is incorrect or fields are empty)

- Generates a personalized ticket after clicking the button

- Footer includes credit to Frontend Mentor
